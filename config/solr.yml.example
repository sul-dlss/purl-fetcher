# = jetty_path key
# each environment can have a jetty_path with absolute or relative
# (to app root) path to a jetty/solr install.
#
# jetty_path is used by:
# - solr:marc:index
# - other rake tasks that start up solr automatically for testing
#
# In general you do NOT need to deploy solr in Jetty, you can deploy it however you want.
